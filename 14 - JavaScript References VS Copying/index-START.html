    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    team[3] = "Werka";
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(players, team, team2);
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'weeee';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person, {number: 99 });
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      social: {
        twitter: 'yes',
        facebook: 'no'
      }
    };
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    console.log(wes, dev);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
